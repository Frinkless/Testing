difference between print and println.
What are variables?
    Variables are like containers that we use to store data in our programs.
what are DataTypes?
    DataTypes are used to store/identify different type of data in variables.
Primitive dataType:
There are eight basic datatypes in Java.
    byte - extra small whole number box
    short - small whole number box
    int - medium size whole number box - widely used
    long - large whole number box - need to put the "l" letter at the end
    float - small container for decimal numbers - need to put the "f" letter at the end
    double - medium container for decimal numbers - widely used
    char - smallest datatype for storing the characters
    boolean - to store true or false
Non-primitive datatypes in Java.
    Advanced data types built using the above mentioned 8 primitive datatypes.
How do we decide what data type we should use for a variable?
    We decide based on two tings on is what type of data we are plainning to store and second what type of operations
    we will be performing on that data.
What are naming conventions in Java?
    Others will not be able to understand your coding easily.
    First letter should be lower case and after first letter of each word upper case.
    This is camelCasing.

            // int myintagevariable=15
            // int myIntAgeVariable=20;
            // int x=20;
            // second convention is easy to ready
   PascalCase. Class names starts with upper case letter. like E1Print
   Packages will be in lower case only. like class1
String concatenation:
    String concatenation allows us to join two strings together.
Arithmetic operators - simple operation we use in math:
    Symbols that we use to perform simple math operations + - / * %
