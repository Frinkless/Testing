Scanner Class in java:
    Scanner is a class just like the classes that we create.
    but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
    This class has a lot of methods which can help us take the input from the keyboard.

Logical Operators
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 logical operators in Java.
    AND(&&)
    OR (||)
    NOT(!)
NOT (!):
    Reverses the conditions if something is true it will make it false, if something is false it will make it true.
OR(||):
    Logical Or help us to combine multiple boolean conditions in a way that when one condition is true the overall
    result is true.
AND(&&):
    Logical AND helps us combine the conditions in aw ay that we only get an overall true when all the conditions
    are true.

Loop:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code as long as condition is true. We have while, do while, for loops.
Why should we use loops:
    Loops help us reduce duplicate code.
When we should use the while loop.
    When we do not know the number of iterations in advance its better we use while loop.
    For loop is better when we know the number of iterations in advance.

When should we use switch statements:
    We should use switch when we are checking the same variable against multiple values and for each value we want to
    do something different.
