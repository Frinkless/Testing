Scanner class:
    Scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the
    user from keyboard. Just like scanner class we have so many
    other classes that we can use from Java and other libraries.
   These classes are divided into methods each method can do something
   useful. Like nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble().
