Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code until and condition fails. There are 4 main types of loops in java.
    1) While loop
    2) Do While loop
    3) For loop
    4) Enhanced for loop
While loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario
    Iteration is not fixed, we use While loop. If the number of iterations is not fixed,
    it is recommended to use the while loop.
    For example when we are searching for a product from amazon we keep on clicking the next button util we find it.
Do While loop:
    When we want to execute the body of the loop at lease once before we check the condition that's when we should be
    using the do while loop.
For:
    For is better choice when we know the number of iterations in advance.
    For example we want to print the 10 numbers.
Array:
    Array is a collection of multiple variables. Every variable is given a number called as index that we can use to
    access that variable.
