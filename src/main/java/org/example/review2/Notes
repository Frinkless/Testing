Type casting:
    Type casting is moving the data from one data type to another. When we move
    something from a smaller date type to larger data type. It's called
    automatic/widening/implicit.

    When we move something from a bigger box to smaller box it is called
    manual/narrowing/explicit.
Data Types from smaller to larger:
    1)byte
    2)short
    3)integer
    4)long
    5)float
    6)double
When should we use type casting?
    when we combine the code from different sources we might need t
    perform this type of casting to make the code
    compatible
Relational operators:
    Relational operators help us compare data.
    == this means equal, if something is same or not
    true or false result will be printed
    != if something is not same returns true
    > if the value on left side is greater than the right side returns true
    < if the value on left side is smaller than right side returns true
    >= if the value on left side is greater or equal than right side returns true
    <= if the value on left side is smaller or equal than right side returns true
If statements:
    if statements help computer to execute the code conditionally.
    Without if conditions almost all the programs will be useless. They will not
    be able to take any decisions.
    There are many variations of these statements.
    if statements - one condition and one action

    if else statements - one condition two actions

    if else if statements - multiple conditions multiple actions.

    Nested if statements - one action is executed under another conditions
