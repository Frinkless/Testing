Break keyword:
    Break keyword breaks the loop.We always use Break keyword with if conditions once the condition is met it stops the
    loop even if there are still iterations remaining.
Why should we use Break:
    If we use Break we can save a lot of unnecessary processing by terminating the loop once the goal is complete.
Continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip unnecessary calculations.
    If an element meets a condition that element is skipped and we move to the next element.
Why should we use?
    to save resources to avoid unnecessary calculations.
Note:
    Break and continue keyword are always written with if conditions inside the loop.

    in a 2D array we use two indexes one to specify the row and other to specify the column.
