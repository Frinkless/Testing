Arrays:
    Arrays are collections of multiple variables. These variables have indexes which help us retrieve and store data
    inside the array.
Why should we use Arrays:
    When we have a lot of data storing in inside variables is not feasible.
Syntax:
    Datatype[] ArrayName=new DataType[Size];
    int [] numbers=new int[5];
    Approach2:
    Datatype [] ArrayName={element1, element2, element3, element4};
    int [] numbers={10, 20, 30, 45, 50};
Enhanced for loop:
    Enhanced for loop is simplified version of normal for loop where the elements are pulled from the array
    automatically one by one. There is no index involved in this type of loop.
Nested Loops:
    Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop. Any type of loop can be present in any type of loop.
Why do we need Nested Loops?
